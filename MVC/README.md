## Model-view-Controller

Its a design pattern that tells us how to organise the various species of code depending on what they do. Its the second most important factor when writing code that you might be judged on.

Essentially its allows us to split our application components into the three layers. Making our code easier to read, update and improve because each layer is responsible for just one thing.




The user "uses" the controller by making requests against it the controller in turn updates or manipulates the data in the model. When the data in the model is updated the view which the users sees is updated with that data.

### 3 Layers

- Controller
- Model
- View
